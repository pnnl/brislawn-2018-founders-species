# Data

### 16S_otus_vsearch

This contains the processed 16S data, including an OTU table (`.biom`), sequences of OTU centroids (`.fna`), a phylogenetic tree (`.tre`), and some log files (`.log`). These are all the needed inputs for the main `.Rmd` analysis script.

### 18S_otus_vsearch

This contains the processed 18S data. It's in the same format as the 16S data.

### Raw data

Genetic sequencing data is available on OSF for both [16S and 18S amplicons](https://osf.io/a48vj/).
